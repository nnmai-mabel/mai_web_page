## Project description

### Usage
To get the best view of the web, please place it on <strong> fullscreen with the resolution of 2,560 by 1,600 pixels.</strong> The information below will guide you throughout the content of the webpage and how to obtain most information from it.

### Heading
This heading includes 4 tabs, which are <strong>Home, Education, Hobbies,</strong> and <strong>Contact</strong>. It also includes a button with which user can toggle between light mode and dark mode of the web. These heading, tabs, and button will appear throughout the web page, despite any tab user is currently on.

### Home tab
The Home tab is the default tab of this webpage, which means whenever the web is reloaded, it will display this Home tab, in which a hello message and a hello image is presented, with a placeholder for a user to enter a name, which will be displayed on the heading space of the tab when user hit the button 'Apply' in the assistance of the 'onload' event. When there is nothing in the local storage, the web will display the text 'Hello World!' and light theme as default. The user name and theme that the user choose will be stored in local storage, and the next time user open the web, the web  will display that theme and name.

There is a hello button under the yellow hello image, when it is clicked, a photo of myself with the university will be displayed in the place of the hello image along with the photographer's name.

The Education tab displays my personal education path in the most recent years.

In the background section, there is a photo of myself on this tab, under which there is a button. When clicking the button, another photo of me will appear in the place of the current one, along with proper credit to the photographer. Next to the photo is my education information since when I was a highschool student and now an IT student at the University of South Australia.

### Hobbies tab
The Hobbies tab displays my hobbies, which I like to do in my free time, and for the user to see whether they have anything in common with me.

The first section on this tab is about my hobby to travel and take photos. There is two photos, one about sunset, and the other one is about a jetty, in this section, under which along with two buttons. When the user click each button, another photo will appear and replace the current one, along with proper credit of photographer.

### Footer
The footer represents the credit to me, the owner of this webpage. The footer will scroll when the user scroll to see the content on the web page.

## Technology
This web page use <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> language in Visual Studio Code environment to make. HTML is used to display the content of the webpage, CSS is used to style the web page and provide it with more colors and beauty, and JavaScript is used to implement functions that makes the web page more dynamically, i.e. entering a name and clicking button to update the heading, or clicking a button to change the photo and update with proper credit of photographer.

## Challenges
When making this web, I encountered a lot of challenges, for example, how to write correct function to make the toggle theme button or to dynamically updating the heading. I have done research about these, and figure out the way to do these functions, as well as have some helpful pages to provide the content that I need, which are displayed inside comments in the code.
